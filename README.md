#cake_data

I created this repo to play around and learn the ggplot2 package for R

I wanted an interesting data set to plot so compiled one about when free food is left in the kitchen at work by scraping emails sent by my co-workers. The data set includes time stamps, what the food was, whether the free food was due to a release celebration.

Data is visualised with R package ggplot2
